# Course Structure Suggestions

How you structure the class is up to you as the teacher. But we recommend you follow a structure similar to the one below to create a dynamic, self-driven, and engaging experience.

We suggest you use a mix of formal instruction (lecture) and self-directed exploratory learning (students working on their own or in a small group to discover solutions to challenges). Programming is a skill best learned by doing. Students won't learn by simply listening to a lecture or observing someone else's code. Thus, each week's materials include some materials for you to present. Plus some planned independent time for students to implement what you've taught.

Our pilot of the class will follow this format:

* We'll be meeting as a class once per week for the second half of the school year.
* I plan to cover one lesson per week.
* I will have a short lab-style activity for students to do each week. If there's time, I'll have them work on that in class. If not, it will be homework due the next week.
* I will make myself available to students via email
* I'm going to use the Startup Weekend-style class lab project suggested below. 

## Equipment

Titanium Mobile is at the mercy of the mobile operating system publishers when it comes to required hardware/software. This is because Titanium uses those vendors' software development kits in the app building process. That means to develop an iOS app, you'll need a Mac -- Apple publishes its tools for OS X only. You can develop Android on either Mac or Windows. In any case, you'll need to download and install those software development kits in addition to Titanium.

Fortunately, there's an online service that will help ease all the setup. And it will let you build Titanium apps for iOS without requiring you to have a Mac. The service is <a href="https://www.foundry22.com/home">Foundry22</a> and their service is free!

If you have Macs available, install all the software on them. It will speed development, testing, and deployment to your devices for testing. But if your computer lab has only Windows computers (or older computers), Foundry22 will be perfect for you.

## Pre-requisites

To maximize the time available in class for teaching Titanium, we recommend you ask students to complete the following steps prior to the start of the course:

* Programming basics -- students must have a fundamental understanding of programming. For that we recommend they: 
** Visit http://www.khanacademy.org/cs/tutorials/programming-basics 
** Create an account
** Complete each of the nine tutorials
* JavaScript -- students will need to know the basics of JavaScript to be productive with Titanium:
** Visit http://learn.appendto.com/lesson/javascript-101 
** Watch all seven videos in the JavaScript 101 section (total time is 41 minutes)
** Watch all six videos in the JavaScript 102 section (total time is 42 minutes)
* Titanium -- students should have a basic understanding of what Titanium is, and how it works.
* Visit http://vimeopro.com/appcelerator/building-native-mobile-applications and watch the first video (00-Titanium Overview) which is 19 minutes long.


## End-of-class project

We suggest you assign an end-of-class / final project. We recommend you use the Startup Weekend style approach. But, you can also let students work individually, in small groups, or as a class on a project you assign. 

### Startup Weekend style project

To make the end of class project fun and inspiring, we suggest you use a Startup Weekend model. In this model, students "pitch" their own app ideas to the class. Students form teams and work together to  select from and then create the best of those app ideas. Then at the end, teams show off their work and the class votes on the best app. (In the real implementation of this model, investors often provide business funding for the winning team so they can launch their business. We don't expect you to arrange that!)

* In the first week of class, announce and describe the goal of the Startup Weekend model program. Explain the rules and general schedule.
* Give students a week or two to think up app ideas. Then, have a "pitch day" at which students who have an idea for an app presents it to the class. Not every student will have an idea to pitch. 
** Students should consider the business aspects of their app -- how they would or could make the app a success -- and include that in their pitch. These "business aspects" don't necessarily mean how they'll sell the app or make money. Depending on the nature of their app idea, it could involve how to grow an audience of users, provide support, or manage updates.
* At the end of the pitch day, students will choose to join what they feel is the best app idea to form project teams. Teams must include at least two students. If someone presents an idea and no one wants to join his or her team, that student must join another team. This structure forces students to work in teams, which matches how real-world jobs are structured.
* Encourage students to work with their teammates outside of the class time. They can work virtually with online interactions via Google Hangouts, Skype chats, Facebook chats, etc. Make sure to schedule time each week for in-class project time. This will typically take the "hackathon" format where students work in a group setting with their teammates while you circulate between teams offering guidance and advice.
* During the final week of the term, have students present their apps. Team members should work together for their presentation -- maybe one talking while the other demos the app. Then, have a closed-ballot vote on the best app. An app doesn't have to be finished to win but must demonstrate what the students have learned and the key points of the app's purpose.
** You might ask a local business or civic group to sponsor a prize for the winners.
** You might ask your local newspaper / TV station / tech bloggers to attend the app presentations and final vote.

### Individual / group projects

While we prefer the Startup Weekend style course project format, you can also use the more traditional individual project format. In that, each student work work independently on his or her own project. You could assign an app project or let students create their own app ideas. If you choose this format, we suggest you set aside weekly or bi-weekly in-class time to give students time to work on this project with you and the other students present for help and support.
